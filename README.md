# ToDoListFinal

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.5.

<h1 style="font-weight:bold">Knowing the toDoList</h1>
<p>The site consists of a to-do-list that, like the others, displays tasks that the user needs to do during his day.</p>
<p>I made this project to exercise the concepts learned from Angular. It's my first code using this framework</p>
<h1 style="font-weight:bold">Navigating the page</h1>
<p>It's a very simple page to use. To add a task just click on "Add Task" and be directed to the forms and pass the task information</p>

<p>in the forms the title of the task must be informed, this title will be visible on the card, and the level of importance of that task, urgent, moderate or can wait</p>

<p>When adding a task, it will be visible on the screen for the user, and he can choose between marking the task as completed, by clicking on the check-box, or deleting it, by clicking on the trash can.</p>
